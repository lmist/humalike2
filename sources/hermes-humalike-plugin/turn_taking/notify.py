"""Home-chat alerts when the Humalike API fails; never raises, never blocks.

Delivered to EVERY ``/sethome`` home channel (like the gateway's own startup/
shutdown broadcasts). Rate-limited PER error-kind so a dead service can't spam
and a second, different failure (e.g. a WS drop after an HTTP outage) isn't
masked by the first. Safe to call from any thread — off-loop callers (the
social-learning daemon) are scheduled onto the captured gateway loop.

Kinds: ``auth`` (bad key), ``quota`` (credit/limit), ``unreachable`` (no
connection), ``server`` (5xx), ``ws`` (realtime drop), ``config`` (startup
misconfig). A successful call clears the active kinds and posts one recovery
line.
