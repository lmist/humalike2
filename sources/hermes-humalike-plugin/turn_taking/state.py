"""Shared mutable runtime state for the turn-taking plugin.

One home for every cross-module value, so readers and writers in different
modules never drift onto separate copies — a plain ``global`` only rebinds the
name in its own module, so the moment this state is split across files it MUST be
referenced as ``state.NAME`` everywhere. No logic lives here: only the maps, the
contextvar, the captured loop, and the open-lock the pipeline threads through.

These names are this module's public surface (accessed as ``state.NAME`` from the
sibling modules), so they carry no leading underscore.

# hook). Round-tripped through the service's respond.metadata → echoed verbatim on
# every delivered bubble frame → read by delivery._forward. First use: the Telegram

# General. Empty/absent for non-topic chats and WhatsApp.

# turn runs via _run_agent's recursive follow-up (run.py:19091) INSIDE the prior
# turn's task, so an inbound-task set would never reach it. Both turn paths compute
# the reply anchor from their event right before _run_agent (first run.py:9460,
# queued run.py:19075), each with the raw event in scope — so binding event.message_id
# there, before copy_context() snapshots it for the worker thread, gives every turn
# (first or queued) its correct id. We bind event.message_id (NOT the anchor return
# value, which is None on Telegram topics) — the same id the decide side keys by.
