    When ``send`` carries the agent's reply for a "speak" turn, naturalize it

    that avoids the duplicate (whole draft + its split bubbles). Everything else

    The "this is the draft" signal is ``PENDING_ANSWERS`` (keyed by exact answer
    text), registered by the transform hook for the answer it naturalized; the send
    whose content matches is dropped, so a racing tool-notice can't be consumed by
    mistake. The draft still reaches Hermes history (persisted before send).

    A suppressed send returns a synthetic success directly — it never calls the
    real ``send``. WhatsApp/Telegram happen to no-op empty content themselves
    (an early-return before any formatting/API call), but Slack's ``send`` has no
    such guard: an empty ``chat.postMessage`` errors, which trips the host's
    plain-text-fallback retry (``_send_with_retry``) and re-sends the very draft
    we were suppressing. Not calling ``orig`` at all sidesteps that regardless of
    whether a given platform happens to have an empty-content guard.

    raw ``event.message_id``, so the respond side must look it up by the SAME id.
    But ``_run_agent`` only receives ``event_message_id`` = the reply ANCHOR
    (``_reply_anchor_for_event(event)``), which is ``None`` on Telegram forum-topic
    groups — there the lookup misses and the bot stays silent. The raw event isn't

    at run.py:9460 (``event``) and the queued follow-up at run.py:19075
    (``pending_event``). Wrapping this one small staticmethod therefore covers both,
    queue-robustly, in the turn's own frame before ``copy_context()`` snapshots the
