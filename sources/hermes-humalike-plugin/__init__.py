"""Hermes turn-taking plugin — entry point and registration.

The implementation is split into three sibling packages this module wires
together:
  - ``turn_taking/``      the turn-taking machinery, itself split by concern:
      service (HTTP/WS I/O), state (shared runtime state), delivery (bubble
      delivery + thread lifecycle), core (decide/naturalize + system-prompt
      build), patching (the gateway monkeypatches), hooks (the plugin hooks)
  - ``social_learning/``  the per-conversation voice card (pre_llm_call hook)
  - ``soul/``             the SOUL.md persona feature (the /soul command)
  - ``native_memory``     optionally strips native memory's *style* capture so
                          the voice card owns style; off unless
                          ``native_memory.strip_style: true`` in config.yaml

This module only registers the plugin's command, hooks, and patches.
