"""`/connect` — link this agent to a Humalike account (device authorization).

The chat-first cousin of ``hermes setup``: the user sends ``/connect`` from any
platform, gets back a login link, opens it in a browser on ANY device (their
phone works — the gateway box never needs a display, so SSH/VM/Docker installs
are first-class), approves, and the freshly minted API key is saved. The key
goes live in-process immediately (``os.environ`` — every Humalike call reads it
fresh via ``_config.api_key()``) and into ``~/.hermes/.env`` for the next boot,
so no restart is needed.

Server side is Humalike's RFC 8628 lane on the keys service:
  POST {base}/v1/keys/actions/cli_create  -> {device_code, user_code,
                                              verification_uri, expires_in, interval}
  POST {base}/v1/keys/actions/cli_poll    {device_code} -> {status, api_key?, account?}

``status`` is pending/authorized/denied/expired; on ``authorized`` the response
carries the ``ak_…`` key exactly once (the server deletes the session as the
claim). Any HTTP error while polling is transient by contract — keep polling;
the session TTL, not this loop, is the real deadline.

Command handlers only get ``raw_args`` and return one reply string, so the
approval outcome is delivered later via the route captured at command time
(``state.LAST_ADAPTER``/``LAST_CHAT_ID``, set by the inbound gate for the
/connect message itself) — sent through the genuine pre-patch ``send`` so the
draft-suppression patch can't swallow it.
