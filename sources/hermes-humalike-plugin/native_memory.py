"""Stop native memory from capturing conversational *style*.

Hermes's built-in memory tool is told to record how the user/group communicates
(tone, formality, verbosity, the group's norms). The Humalike plugin already
owns that layer: the per-conversation voice card in ``social_learning/`` learns
the live style and injects it into every reply. Letting native memory ALSO
persist style double-captures it — and a stale saved snapshot then fights the
live card. So at register time we surgically remove the style clause from the
memory tool and forbid re-capturing it, leaving durable FACT memory (name, role,
timezone, stated preferences) untouched.

Two edits, both at load time, no hooks:
  1. memory tool schema description (``tools.memory_tool`` via the registry) —
     read live each request, so mutating it in place takes effect.
  2. ``MEMORY_GUIDANCE`` — imported by-name into ``agent.system_prompt`` and
     ``agent.prompt_builder``, so we patch the binding the prompt builder reads.

Opt-in: does nothing unless ``native_memory.strip_style: true`` is set in
config.yaml — by default native memory is left completely stock.

Best-effort and idempotent; never raises. No-op on a Hermes without these
internals (the imports simply fail and each edit reports False). The host
imports are deferred into the functions so importing this module never needs
the Hermes runtime — the register-time call is the only place it touches it.

Run the checks directly:  python3 tests/test_native_memory.py
